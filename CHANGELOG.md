# Changelog

## [v1.2.0] - 2025-02-14

### Lean Starter Kit Refactor
- **Added root `AGENTS.md`**: Instructions for AI agents on how to use the repository
- **Added `GETTING_STARTED.md`**: 5-minute quickstart guide for new users
- **Updated `README.md`**: Repositioned as "Team AI Directives Starter Kit"
- **Updated personas**: Added Rule References to Java, Python, Data Analyst, DevOps personas

### Architecture Simplification
- **Skills are self-contained**: Removed all `@rule:/@example:` references from SKILL.md files
- **Rules via personas**: Rules now accessed through persona Rule References, not skills
- **Deleted redundant files**:
  - `skills/AGENTS.md` (moved to root)
  - `skills/SKILL_TEMPLATES.md` (redundant with AGENTS.md)
  - `skills/external_skills.md` (replaced by `.skills.json` registry)

### Breaking Changes
- `skills/AGENTS.md` deleted - use root `AGENTS.md` instead
- `skills/SKILL_TEMPLATES.md` deleted - use root `AGENTS.md` instead
- Skills no longer contain `@rule:` or `@example:` references

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-02-01

### Skills Simplification & External Skills Registry
- **Added skills/external_skills.md**: URL-based registry for external skills from vercel-labs and other sources
- **Simplified skills frontmatter**: Removed complex metadata, keeping only name + description (vercel-labs format)
- **Refactored skills/ directory structure**: Moved vercel-react-best-practices to skills/ root, removed fullstack/ directory
- **Updated skills/AGENTS.md**: Removed metadata references, added external skills section
- **Updated CONTRIBUTING.md**: Removed metadata requirements, added external skills contribution guidelines
- **Updated README.md**: Removed skills.manifest.yml references, added external skills explanation
- **Simplified vercel-react-best-practices skill**: Updated frontmatter to vercel-labs simple format

### Key Features
- **External Skills**: URL-based registry for skills from other repositories, fetched on-demand via agent webfetch
- **Simple Frontmatter**: Adopted vercel-labs format (name + description only) for better LLM compatibility
- **LLM-Based Discovery**: Skills discovered using natural language matching instead of structured metadata
- **Flattened Structure**: Simplified skills directory structure following vercel-labs patterns

### Breaking Changes
- Removed complex skill metadata (category, platforms, keywords, requires_context, use_cases)
- Deleted skills.manifest.yml - skills discovered via LLM matching instead
- Deleted docs/SKILL_METADATA_STANDARD.md - no longer needed with simple format
- External skills now referenced via URL instead of being copied/wrapped

### Migration Notes
- Existing skills with complex metadata will still work but should be simplified gradually
- Teams using git submodules will automatically get new external skills registry
- Skill discovery now relies on LLM matching rather than structured metadata
- External skills are fetched on-demand via agent webfetch capabilities
