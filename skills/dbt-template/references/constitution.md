## Relevant Principles for dbt Projects

### Principle 2: Build for Observability and Reproducibility
All features must include logging, metrics, and deterministic workflows so issues can be traced quickly.

### Principle 4: Tests Drive Confidence
Write automated tests before or alongside new logic. Refuse to ship when critical coverage is missing.

### Principle 9: Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative. No features beyond what was asked, no abstractions for single-use code, no "flexibility" that wasn't requested, no error handling for impossible scenarios. If 200 lines could be 50, rewrite it. Every senior engineer should agree the solution is not overcomplicated.

### Principle 11: Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria and measure outcomes against business objectives.
